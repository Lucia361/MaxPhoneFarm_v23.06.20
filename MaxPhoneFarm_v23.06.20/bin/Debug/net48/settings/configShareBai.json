  "txtComment": "Cat is friendly now and still has attitude, good combo.\r\nPoor thing. She wasn't mean of angry, just injured and scared.\r\nthe dodo is one of the few reasons i havent fully given up on humanity\r\nAnimals have fear inside there little body’s just like us in our big body’s . We need  more people like this good lady.\r\nFun cat fact!: all kittens are born feral and it’s the early human interaction that changes that\r\ncan't believe how much care the lady took of the cat!!! hats off to her hard work and kind affection. whn the cat started to walk, its really unbelievable 😍\r\nVet: \"She's probably not going to walk again.\"\r\nthat cat isn't mean, it's scared. Imagine you were stuck in a terrible place like that and then you had two giants of another species handling you and touching you and you couldn't even move and defend yourself properly.... such a cutie pie. I'm glad she learned to walk again. and that she has a loving family\r\nCat at the start: get out human i hate you!After being cared for: hi human give me the blessed headpats\r\nWhy are this cats eyes prettier than mine? She looks like she’s got eyeliner for kitties on.\r\nThe women who rescued this beautiful kitty are adorable, caring and loving ones. I love you girls!! You are my Heroes. 😘😻❤🌈🏵😘🥰👍\r\nThat’s not anger or being mean, she’s scared.\r\nincredible story! This kind hearted woman has achieved a miracle.\r\nThey're not angry or mean, the cat is just anxious and scared.\r\nShe is a special queen who has people who love her.\r\nThat's incredible. Just goes to show that when animals and humans come together in harmony, Nature delivers miracles. Thanks for sharing this amazing video.\r\n\"Dirty and muddy\". If the cat fell in a sewer hole it is Def NOT dirt and mud on her. I'll give you one guess as to what it is...\r\nPain meds The Cat: aw deal that makes me fell bets hiss\r\nIs there a reason why every veterinarian basically says, \"there is literally no hope for this animal, give up\"?\r\nLove the black marks near eyes looks like eyelashes •-•\r\nThe people who do this work are the greatest testament to humanity, imho.\r\nMy kitty slept or lay like that sometimes, on her back, legs all splayed.  So funny.  It is a position of complete and total trust.\r\nSo beautiful to see someone give a helpless creature like this a chance to live and be happy and be loved, instead of just putting her down.   :)\r\nMy heart has been crushed in how emotional this is.\r\nIt's amazing how they didn't give up on her 😭. And now she's walking.\r\nI still believe\r\nThis channel makes me want to pay more attention to my dog and now, he knows how to sit, lay down, and roll by my command!\r\nProof for fact there are angels among us. She needed love, pain relief, love, trust, warmth, love, decent food, love, patience, love, kindness, love and many many skritches... did l mention love? ♡ Thank God for y'all- lil girl had a great forever home with you!\r\nGood job! Straight to the front of the line at the Pearly Gates for this woman.\r\nThis makes me want to get a cat. I mean look how precious she is😌✨\r\nCats are so remarkable, they are gifts I am grateful for everyday. Glad this little one was given a chance.\r\nQue dios os bendiga, por ayudar a esa pequeñas gatita. Mis saludos Cordiales jc.\r\nAngels on the earth that’s what these people are\r\n28 Years waiting for my wife to get off work happy tears in my eyes. God bless you people and that cute little thing all the best to you. Cant wait to get home to our cats\r\nI'm not crying, you're crying!\r\nJust when she started walking to the food bowl, it felt like someone just cut onions!\r\nOMG i'm not crying watching this at 5am. so happy for kitty.\r\nThis video made me cry when she started to walk🥰🥰\r\nAnd one morning she was standing!\r\nSeeing her sleeping belly up was so heartwarming\r\n\r\n\r\nI cried when I realized I saw that it was homeless 😭😭😭😭😭😭\r\nToo young to drink milk out of a bowl. You've got to bottle feed them, and make sure it's kitten formula.\r\nOmg this makes me cry😞😢😢I wish their mom is alive🥺🥺😭😭😭🤧🤧\r\nThis makes me cry cause the cute kittens and the song is sad at the start😭😭😭\r\nThats so sad thanks for taking care of baby kitten!😻😭\r\nRIP mother 😢 they are cute I would take care of them\r\nThey don’t take care of kittens because the “owner” found a street cat and they must have known it but it must have died and the “owner” can’t look after it. Good thing @Animal Lover has looked after them.\r\nI would definitely take them home but my whole family is allergic to cats I wish I wasn’t allergic to cats\r\nI really want those cats they are so cute\r\nThe thing i like about cats is how gentle and reliable they are. You can pick them up easily. If you want them in your bed you can bring them there. And they are very cuddly",
